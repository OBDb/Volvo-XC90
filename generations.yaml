    description: "The first-generation Volvo XC90 was Volvo's pioneering entry into the luxury SUV market, built on the P2 platform shared with the S80 sedan. The exterior featured traditional Volvo design elements adapted to an SUV form, with a boxy yet refined silhouette, distinctive tail lamps, and a practical seven-seat configuration. Initially offered with a range of engines including five-cylinder turbocharged petrol and diesel options, a 2.9L twin-turbocharged inline-six, and even a short-lived 4.4L Yamaha-developed V8, the XC90 provided varied performance options across different markets. The interior emphasized versatility with three rows of seats, the second and third of which could fold flat to create a substantial cargo area. Safety innovations were numerous, including Roll Stability Control, a reinforced roof structure, and advanced side-impact protection that helped the XC90 achieve class-leading safety ratings. A significant facelift in 2007 updated the exterior styling, interior features, and technology offerings. Despite an unusually long production run of nearly 12 years, the first-generation XC90 remained competitive and popular, particularly in North America, establishing Volvo's reputation in the luxury SUV segment with its combination of practicality, safety, and understated premium qualities."

    description: "The second-generation Volvo XC90, introduced for the 2015 model year, represented a complete reinvention and served as the flagship for Volvo's transformation under Geely ownership. Built on the new Scalable Product Architecture (SPA) platform, it features a distinctive, confident design with Thor's Hammer LED headlights, a bold grille, and elegant proportions. The interior showcases Scandinavian luxury with premium materials including wood, leather, and metal accents, centered around a 9-inch portrait-oriented touchscreen that controls most vehicle functions. A revolutionary aspect of this generation is the exclusive use of 2.0-liter four-cylinder engines across all variants, leveraging turbocharging, supercharging, and electrification to deliver performance comparable to larger engines with improved efficiency. The T8 Twin Engine plug-in hybrid variant combines a turbo- and supercharged petrol engine with electric motors to produce nearly 400 horsepower while offering around 18-25 miles of pure electric range. Safety and driver assistance technology reached new heights with Pilot Assist semi-autonomous driving capability, Run-off Road Protection, and numerous other innovations. A significant update in 2019 brought subtle design refinements, while a more comprehensive facelift in 2022 introduced updated styling, improved battery capacity for PHEV models, and a transition to Google-based infotainment systems. The second-generation XC90 has been critically acclaimed, winning numerous awards including 2016 North American Truck of the Year, and has successfully positioned Volvo as a distinctive alternative to established German luxury brands."
