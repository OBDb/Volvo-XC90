  - name: "First Generation (2002)"
    start_year: 2002
    end_year: 2014
    description: "The first-generation Volvo XC90 was Volvo's pioneering entry into the luxury SUV market, introduced at the 2002 North American International Auto Show and built on the P2 platform shared with the S80 sedan. Production began in August 2002 at Volvo's Torslandaverken in Sweden. The exterior featured traditional Volvo design elements adapted to an SUV form, with a boxy yet refined silhouette, distinctive tail lamps, and a practical seven-seat configuration. Initially offered with a range of engines including five-cylinder turbocharged petrol (2.5T, 3.2L) and diesel options, a 2.9L twin-turbocharged inline-six (T6), and a Yamaha-developed 4.4L V8 introduced in 2005, the XC90 provided varied performance options across different markets. The interior emphasized versatility with three rows of seats, the second and third of which could fold flat to create a substantial cargo area. Safety innovations were numerous, including Roll Stability Control (industry-first in 2003), a reinforced roof structure marketed as ROPS, and advanced side-impact protection (SIPS) that helped the XC90 achieve class-leading safety ratings including IIHS Top Safety Pick. The XC90 won Motor Trend's 2003 SUV of the Year and North American Car of the Year. Production continued in China as the XC Classic from 2014-2016 after Swedish production ended."
